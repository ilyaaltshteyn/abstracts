0,0,"The Journal of Social, Evolutionary, and Cultural Psychology is an online initiative designed to bridge sub-disciplines of psychology in order to gain holistic insights into human behavior, emotion, cognition, and motivation. We believe that the perspectives of social, evolutionary, and cultural psychology each provide unique advantages for psychological investigation. Social psychology emphasizes individual functioning within the local group; cultural psychology emphasizes the role of oneâs social environment and emergent cultural practices; and evolutionary psychology emphasizes the adapted function of particular behaviors at the level of the individual. In this editorial, we introduce the philosophical questions guiding the formation of this new journal.

2,2,"Past research on human mating behaviors has operationalized parental investment (PI) in terms of sex differencesâwith females reflecting high parental investment (and resultant long-term mating strategies) and males demonstrating low parental investment (and resultant short-term mating strategies). The present research draws on methods adopted from social psychology to operationalize parental investment in terms of conscious and non-conscious attitudinal indices. In a sample of young heterosexual adults, we examined sex differences in two measures of attitudes toward oneâs ability/willingness to invest in parenting. One measure was a self-report index while the other was based on autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses. No sex difference was obtained regarding self-report responses to PI. However, males showed significantly larger increases in heart rate than females when presented with PI-relevant (compared with PI-neutral) stimuli. The findings are consistent with past research suggesting that males are less prepared to confront issues associated with parenting than are females. Further, the findings suggest that males are somewhat unaware of their own perceived lack of parental preparedness. The incongruity between males' self-reports and their ANS responses is discussed with regard to Error Management Theory (EMT; Haselton  Buss, 2000). We also discuss more generally how this research may serve as a model for using the subjectivist tradition in social psychology to expand our study of objective variables derived from the evolutionary perspective.

3,3,"Cultural psychology, and other social sciences (e.g. cultural anthropology, sociology), seek to document cultural variation, yet have difficulty providing strong empirical tests of explanations for that variation. It is argued here that an effective means of testing hypotheses regarding the origin of, and persistence and change in, cultural variation is by simulating cultural transmission in the lab using certain methods from experimental social psychology. Three experimental methods are reviewed: the transmission chain method, the replacement method, and the constant-group method. Although very few studies have explicitly simulated specific cross-cultural patterns, much potential exists for future investigations. This integration of small-scale experimental simulations and large-scale observational or historical data is facilitated by an evolutionary framework for the study of culture, and has a precedent in the biological sciences, where experiments are used to simulate and explain the processes of biological evolution.

4,4,"The issue of socialization for antisocial conduct within a society is often set up in terms of deficit notions, comparing the antisocial conduct with (normative) prosocial behavior and discovering that the former entails the absence of the latter. This view seems to overlook relevant dynamic interplay between personal-cultural organization of human action on the one hand, and collective-cultural valuation of different forms of conduct (e.g., as ""prosocial"" versus ""antisocial""), on the other. When one transcends the conceptual dichotomy between the ""prosocial"" and ""antisocial"" labeled phenomena, it becomes possible to see that under some conditions of collective-cultural semiotic value construction, the application of the ""pro-social"" and ""anti-social"" labels can become flexible in a collective-cultural context. ""Prosocial"" acts may become semiotically transformed into ""antisocial"" ones, and vice versa. Both forms of such transformation can be viewed as relevant for the cultural organization of mind and society.

5,5,"The concept of 'moral sense' plays an important role in books on philosophy, psychology and popular science written by authors who write in English and who take the English language for granted. For example, in his recent book The God Delusion Richard Dawkins (2006) states that ""we have a moral sense which is built into our brains, like our sexual instinct or our fear of heights"" (p. 214). Yet there is no expression like moral sense in other languages, not even European ones like Spanish or German, let alone non-European ones, like Chinese. Nor was there any moral sense in English before the phrase was invented by so-called ""British moralists""-Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, and Hume. This paper traces the origins of the modern Anglo/English concept of 'moral sense'in the influence of Locke's empiricist philosophy on the eighteenth-century 'British moralists', and through them, on the language of British natural scientists, and especially Darwin's. Thus, the paper argues that when contemporary scientists of the English language like Dawkins, Hauser, and others write about the 'moral sense' and present it as a panhuman characteristic evolved through biological evolution, they are looking at ""human nature"" and âhuman moralityâ? through the prism of the English language. Seeing the phrase moral sense, and the discourse based on it, in a cross-linguistic and historical perspective can help us to stretch our imagination as to different possible conceptions of ""morality"" and to go beyond the culture-bound vision of what Dawkins (2006) calls ""moral sense"" and Hauser (2006), a ""universal sense of right and wrong"".

6,6,"This study examined how waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) differentially affects males and females in their preference for female images. A WHR of approximately .70 is considered an indicator of health and fertility for females, and previous research indicates that participants perceive images with WHRs closer to .70 as more attractive (Singh, 1993a; Singh  Young, 1994; Streeter  McBurney, 2003). A sex difference has yet to be found in perceptions of attractiveness. Thirty-four male and thirty-four female participants examined a series of slides.

7,7,"This article first discusses the development of concepts then reviews the literature on catharsis. A new theory is proposed to integrate social, psychological, and neurological components. It builds upon a socio-biological model of emotions by John Dewey and G. H. Mead who proposed that the initiation and climax of bodily emotion process are instinctive, and that conscious feeling occurs to the extent that climax is delayed. This article further develops Shibutani's application of the Dewey-Mead model. The climax idea, together with the concept of an optimal distance for experiencing emotions, seems to explain otherwise puzzling phenomena. It also points toward the conditions under which bodily processes such as laughing and crying become cathartic. The new theory shows the relationship between distancing, role-taking, pendulation in somatic therapy, and recent studies of mirror neurons. One implication of the new theory is that in modern societies emotions may be frequently initiated but seldom achieve resolution. Collective repression of emotions may be one the main causes of large-scale violence.

8,8,"Reviews the book, Dreaming souls: Sleep, dreams and the evolution of the conscious mind by Owen Flanagan (2000). In his book Dreaming Souls, Owen Flanagan weaves philosophy and science together to create a cohesive package of dream theory. This is hardly surprising as his interdisciplinary work has bridged philosophy, psychology and neurobiology. The meat of Flanagan's argument is sandwiched between the beginning and the end of a moralistic and spiritual philosophical debate. His discussions cover a fair amount of historical work from Plato to Freud. He touches on various contemporary issues such as the functional views of both dreaming and sleep. His focus is on setting up his argument using a philosophical, instead of a scientific, framework. Flanagan puts forth a point and then steps through it with care and logic. He does not test hypothesis but instead tests the logic that underlies existing hypothesis. While he spends much of the book discussing the science behind dreaming and sleep it is hardly informative to a well-read scientific audience. Flanagan's reviews of the adaptive theories of dreams all lean towards a byproduct explanation. Flanagan has put forth a good start on the adaptive functionality of sleep. More research needs to be done before we can entertain either a non- adaptationist or an adaptationist account of the evolution of dreaming.

9,9,"Evolutionary Life History Theory (LHT) is a powerful framework that can be used for understanding behavioral strategies as functional adaptations to environmental conditions. Some evolutionary theorists have described how developmental environments can shape behavioral strategies. Theorists and previous research suggest that individuals developing in relatively less certain environments will exhibit riskier, present oriented, behavioral strategies because of the low probability of reproductive success for more cautious approaches. An evolutionary psychology approach to LHT includes the identification of psychological processes that regulate behavioral strategies as a result of developmental experiences. This paper proposes that time perspective is one psychological mechanism that may underlie functional developmental adaptation. A survey study of urban middle school students (N = 607) assessed the relationship between perceptions of local social conditions, time perspective, and risky behaviors. Structural equation model analyses indicated that present and future orientations completely mediated the relationship of positive and negative aspects of students' neighborhood social environment with reports of interpersonal aggression and illicit resource exploitation. This model had a better fit to the data than competing models depicting time perspective as a byproduct of either phenotypic strategy or social-environmental experiences.

10,10,"Drawing on evolutionary social psychology, Pettijohn and Tesser's (1999) Environmental Security Hypothesis (ESH) proposes that during threatening times, people seek mates with more mature features. Pettijohn and Jungeberg (2004) found that Playboy Playmates of the Year (PMOYs), who are determined partly by popularity, exhibited more mature features (older, taller, heavier, larger waist-to-hip ratios [WHRs], lower body mass indexes [BMIs]) during times of hardship. Their composite measure of hard times, however, was heterogeneous; it was unclear weather the effects were driven by economic (unemployment) or existential (suicides, homicides) hardships. The present study critically examined the ESH by replicating and extending Pettijohn and Jungeberg while distinguishing between economic and existential threats. Forty-eight years (1960-2007) of PMOY measures (age, bust, waist, hips, height, weight, WHR, and BMI), two economic measures (Dow Jones industrial average [DJIA], consumer sentiment index [CSI]), and two existential threat measures (pre-versus-post-9/11 years, Doomsday Clock changes) were analyzed. Changes in economic indexes were either unassociated (CSI) or contrary (DJIA) to the ESH, such that taller, heavier women were preferred during prosperous markets. Supporting the ESH, increases in existential threats such as nuclear annihilation (Doomsday Clock) were related to older women and lower BMIs. The efficacy of the ESH is discussed.

11,11,"Rational choice theory of marriage market predicts that mate selectivity responds to operational sex ratios whereby the sex in shorter supply and thus greater demand becomes more selective. In contrast, an evolutionary psychological perspective on mate selectivity predicts that women on average will be more selective than men under most circumstances, and the sex difference will not respond to operational sex ratios. We analyze mate preferences expressed by men and women (n = 2,956) who subscribe to a computer dating service in Tel Aviv, Israel, which has an extremely low sex ratio (646 available single men for 1,000 women).

12,12,"Expatriate adjustment within a social context that included both host nationals and other expatriates was examined in terms of social resources, support for coping responses, and adjustment outcomes in a sample of expatriates residing in Russia (N = 110). Instruments utilized included Ong and Ward's (2005) recently introduced Index of Sojourner Social Support (ISSS) Scale and Black and Stephens' (1989) widely used scale for general adjustment. Results indicate that the general adjustment of expatriates is significantly related to satisfaction with social contact with local nationals (r = .21, p  .05), socioemotional coping support (r = .24, p  .05), and instrumental coping support (r = .21, p  .05).

Overall, this study supports previous research findings that emphasize quality of social contacts over frequency of social contacts as a dimension of cross-cultural adjustment.

This book provides yet another example of the importance and utility of evolutionary psychology (EP) in an area currently void of any evolutionary theory. Throughout the book, Saad presents research on consumer behavior and views it through an evolutionary lens, illustrating parallels between different consumer behaviors, marketing strategies, and our evolved human nature. At the same time, he challenges the social constructionist view that all human behavior is learned through socialization and suggests that our behavior may be, at least in part, affected by our evolved human nature. Throughout the book, Saad illustrates the vast field of knowledge currently untapped by consumer researcher and provides the means by which EP can be used to understand consumer behavior. One criticism of this book is that Saad has tackled two very large problems, mainly the benefit of applying EP principles to current consumer behavior research, as well as the role of our evolutionary lineage in shaping our current behaviors, in a scant 276 pages.

They were also given endowment and theory of mind tasks. The results showed that young children were similar to adults in their preferences for fairness although they tended to make more altruistic offers. They also demonstrated some ability to think strategically about offers as well as some understanding of the importance of reciprocity in bargaining. But their ability to perform a cost-benefit analysis was limited as was their ability to act contingently. A third of the sample showed an endowment effect but whether a child showed this effect did not influence performance in the games.

15,15,"In the majority of human societies parents control the mating decisions of their female offspring and choose spouses for them according to their own preferences. This parental choice determines the course of sexual selection, as men who lack desirable characteristics are excluded from reproduction. Parents prefer as sons-in-law men with traits such as industry and good working ability that enable them to be good in providing resources. However, many of these traits are unobserved, while future sons-in-law have the incentive to lie about their abilities. Consequently, parents have to solve the problem of selecting the most capable son-in-law between men who have the incentive to lie. One way to do so is for parents to impose a substantial cost to any prospective son-in-law. By doing so, parents can reliably test the abilities of potential sons-in-law. It is proposed that this cost takes the form of the two most common marriage institutions, namely bridewealth and brideservice, whose primary function is to enable parents to exercise their choice effectively. The determinants of these two institutions are further explored and evidence from the anthropological literature is provided.

In an attempt to uncover the function of smiling behavior, the assessment of various evolutionarily relevant traits was examined through people's judgments of neutral and smiling photographs. Pictures were rated for ten attributes: attractiveness, generosity, trustworthiness, competitiveness, health, agreeableness, conscientiousness, extroversion, neuroticism, and openness to experience. Although smiling faces received higher scores on several dimensions, the difference in judgments between neutral and smiling varied with the sex composition of the sender-receiver dyad. Overall, smiling influenced men's judgments in a larger extent than women's, especially when faces were female.

In the natural risk condition, participants were told that the task involved natural risk (i.e., risk governed by a stochastic process). In the social risk condition, participants were told that the task involved the risk of being cheated. In both conditions, the game's payoff structure was constant. Participants played 100 trials of IGT. After experiencing a large loss from one option, participants in the social risk condition, who believed that they were seriously cheated, waited longer to choose that option again than did those in the natural risk condition.

19,19,"Existing research on intrasexual competition focuses on the tactics of self-promotion and competitor derogation. In this paper we expand upon these two tactics by developing a framework in which the performers of a competitive action, and their roles, are identified. Using the framework, it is possible to identify nine variations of promotion, and similarly, nine variations of derogation, as potential competitive acts. While only a simplified framework is presented, and one that only considers a single competitor, the framework combines the previous views of promotion and derogation and elaborates upon these views. The framework provides a means by which phenomena such as social comparison and assortative mating can be described, and thus shows merit as a tool that researchers can use to elucidate and integrate the elements of intrasexual competition.

20,20,"Self-perceived mate value is an important concept for evolutionary psychology, and yet there has been little investigation into how it should be measured. Past research has relied upon simple measures, such as self-perceived physical attractiveness, or on instruments where people rate the existence of certain traits. Using a sample of 150 individuals, we show that there are at least seven distinct components of self-perceived mate value. We compare these components with self-ratings of physical attractiveness, current income, as well as one existing measure, the Mate Value Inventory (Kirsner et al., 2003). Only some of these components correlate with these variables, and to varying extents for women and men, suggesting the need for a more comprehensive and sex-specific measure of self-perceived mate value. We discuss the context-dependent nature of mate value, and point to the need for future research to provide confirmatory support for our factors.

21,21,"Among early modern humans, a woman would face stronger competition for a mate the further away she was from the equator. Men were less available because they 1) hunted over longer distances that increased male mortality proportionately and 2) were less able to offset the resulting man shortage through polygyny. The longer the winter, the costlier it became to provision a second wife and her children, since women could not gather food in winter. Women competed the most for mates in the 'continental Arctic,' where wandering herds were the main food source. Conversely, men competed the most for mates in the Tropics, particularly after year-round agriculture emerged. This means of subsistence allowed women to become primary food producers, thereby freeing men to take more wives. Because mate competition has varied in intensity among human populations, sexual selection has correspondingly varied in intensity for certain traits, often highly visible and colorful ones. Intense female-female competition may explain an unusual convergence of color traits in northern and eastern Europeans. Intense male-male competition may explain increased masculinization of body build in highly polygynous agricultural populations of sub-Saharan Africa.

22,22,"Hook-up behavior consists of sexual activity between uncommitted individuals. âHooking upâ? has become pervasive among young adults, particularly on college campuses in the United States, despite inherent emotional, physical, social and health risks. A total of 507 undergraduate students were surveyed to assess the prevalence of, and motivations for, hook-up behavior. Of those students, 64% reported having ever engaged in a hook-up. Of those who had hooked up, 51% had done so with the intention of initiating a traditional romantic relationship; there were no sex differences. Contrary to established notions of uncommitted sexual activity as an evolved behavioral strategy, results are discussed from a synergistic biopsychosocial perspective that situates this complex sexual behavior at the intersection of evolution, basic biology, psychology, and novel cultural factors. A decreasing average age at menarche and increasing age of mother at first birth has created a window of sexually mature but pre-reproductive life that is historically unprecedented in its duration. We suggest this time window, paired with evolved neural correlates of sexual and reproductive behavior, greater acceptance of the social sexualization of youth, and characteristics of the modern collegiate environment, results in the increasing prevalence of hook-ups.

Oxytocin appears to mediate cooperative behaviors by acting on the HPA axis to reduce anxiety, allowing for the expression of approach and helping behaviors. An observational study of 44 young adult males in St. Petersburg, Russia, found no association between circulating basal endocrine measures (oxytocin, cortisol, and testosterone) and prosocial behaviors measured by self-report altruism and empathy scales. Frequency of helping behavior and emotional empathy scores were significantly correlated.

26,26,"Child death has played an important role in the evolution of humans. Of all stages of development, and at all historical times beyond Modern history, childhood has been associated with the highest levels of mortality. Compared to other evolutionary pressures such as surviving as an adult or finding a mate and having children, the odds of genetic failure (i.e., failure to directly contribute to oneâs genetic line) are greatest in childhood. The enormous potential evolutionary pressure exerted by child death should have significantly influenced human psychological adaptations. Despite this potential influence, child death may be one of the least studied influences on human evolutionary psychology.

This paper summarizes the dominant assumptions of history (through one of its key sub-disciplines, labor history) and proposes a reconsideration of that history within the framework of evolutionary psychology. Nonhistorians have begun to develop a Darwinian history, although mostly in terms of sex and the family structure, rather than contextualizing modern forms of social organizations such as unions.

28,28,"Sex differences in mortality rates stem from multiple causes that are best understood when integrated in an evolutionary life history framework. This study investigates the relationship of sex differences in mortality rates across nations to indicators of the life history characteristics of populations. Controlling for gross national income per capita, the overall sex difference in mortality rates was directly related to the adolescent fertility rate, the percentage of newborns with low birth weight, and was inversely related to the average mother's age at birth of first child. Sex differences for behavioral (external) causes of mortality were also directly related to the difference between the average age of males and females at first marriage. These findings indicate that the sex difference in mortality rates is an important life history indicator, and is related to reproductive patterns. Greater sex differences in mortality may reflect greater degrees of male competition for resources, social status, and mates.

We investigated whether sex differences exist between distinguishing facial photos of males and females expressing either pain or sexual pleasure. Photographs obtained from the internet of individuals expressing either emotion were individually shown to ninety-one participants in a slideshow, and participants were asked to identify the emotion. Overall, participants were more able to correctly identify an expression of pain as opposed to sexual pleasure. Participants also showed the highest degree of accuracy when it came to identifying females showing expressions of pain, but were the least accurate at identifying females with expressions of sexual pleasure, and this effect was more pronounced for female raters.

It has been hypothesized that deception and the detection of deception is highly influenced by mating context. The current study investigated sex differences in the detection of deception used in typical human mating situations. Sixty-eight females were tested for deception detection using a video paradigm in which the actors either lied or told the truth. An accompanying survey was given that evaluated common deception tactics. Contrary to previous findings, female deception detection was not significantly above chance. However, knowledge of opposite gender tactics increased deception detection such that those females that were aware of common male tactics were superior at detecting deception. The results, which are preliminary, suggest that the evolutionary advantage females have over males may have a top-down cognitive origin such that knowledge of tactics may influence perceptual abilities.

32,32,"Reiber (2008) recently published an evolutionary model in which PMS is hypothesized to be a byproduct of adaptations that maximize chances of mating and fertilization during the follicular phase of the cycle. How a woman feels during the follicular phase of the cycle should be predictable by evolutionarily relevant variables related to reproduction, such as age, parity, and resources. Prospective daily symptom ratings from 170 women support this view. Symptom load during the follicular week was significantly negatively correlated with age and resources, and positively correlated with parity. Women meeting diagnostic criteria for PMS had significantly lower total symptom loads (that is, they felt better) during the follicular week of the cycle than did women without PMS. This suggests that women have PMS not because something negative happens with the approach of the premenstruum, but rather because evolutionarily adaptive positive states are fostered during the follicular phase of the cycle for some women. This conceptual shift may lead to improvement in definitional and diagnostic approaches, more fruitful proximate research, and better clinical treatment.

Findings suggest that women are willing to consider the most attractive men for all types of romantic relationships.

The role of the peak shift effect in perceptions of physical attractiveness involving women's waist-to-hip ratios (WHRs) in biological motion is presented. Photographs of a coordinated motor pattern, walking, are investigated with a novel measurement method. Evidence is presented that the behavior pattern contains alternating left and right side, attractive (S+) and unattractive (S-), WHR stimuli. A WHR stimulus range is established that is sufficient to generate peak shift effects in perceptions of physical attractiveness. It is predicted that WHRs in attractive behavior patterns will be significantly lower than those previously found to be preferred using 0.70 WHR still images.

Previous studies have found a direct relationship between the OSR and the likelihood of male marriage, although these analyses did not distinguish among age groups. We predicted that more women than men would be married at younger ages, but women would be less likely to be married than men in later adulthood, reflecting age related trends in male and female reproductive values. We predicted that men would use scarcity in a low sex ratio population to their advantage differentially by age, being less likely to marry while young but having higher marital rates than women in older age. This would be consistent with the shift from mating effort to parental investment across the male life course which is apparent in modern societies.

39,39,"The human mind is designed to function in coordination with the social and non-social environment in which our species evolved. A specialized cheater detection mechanism allows humans to be one of a very few species who engage in delayed reciprocal altruism. This mechanism is designed to be vigilant for cheaters, but to allow for honest mistakes, since incorrectly excluding a social exchange partner would be costly. People with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are widely believed to be unable to appreciate others intentions or to use intentions in their calculations, making it likely that those with ASD would not show a difference in cheater detection based on intentionality. We tested this prediction using Wason Selection Tasks (WST) that either described an act of cheating as intentional, or described a failure to fulfill a social exchange that was an honest mistake. For both those with ASD and for the control group, the honest mistake greatly depressed performance on the WST.

40,40,"There is no consensus on what social capital is because there is no widely accepted theory of values. Capital is a resource that helps individuals achieve some goal, so one needs to know what humans seek to achieve before one can define what capital is (social or otherwise). Evolutionary psychology is a strong contender for a general theory of values. From this perspective, social capital is any resource that inheres in relationships between individuals that help them attain reproductive success. An evolutionary psychological perspective on social capital can solve some empirical puzzles: Why women have more kin in their personal networks than men do; why black women are more likely to have children out of wedlock; why social capital often has opposite effects on status attainment of men and women; and why social capital appears to be declining in the US. An evolutionary psychological perspective can tell us what exactly social capital is, why humans are social and social capital is important to them, when and where humans maintain social relationships, and how to measure social capital precisely.

41,41,"Based upon its historical and economic backgrounds, we hypothesized that Kansai (Osaka area) people culturally share the value of self-denigrating humor, as an interpersonal strategy for constructing friendly relationships with others. If this value has been ingrained in the contexts of their daily lives, Kansai people would particularly appreciate blunder-telling behavior, because it is an everyday life-interpersonal strategy of self-denigrating humor for constructing relationships. To test this, we administered a questionnaire study on Kansai and Kanto people (a comparison group). As expected, Kansai people showed more favor towards blunder-telling behavior than Kanto people (Study 1). Also, we discovered that, only Kansai people deeply incorporated the value of blundertelling behavior as a part of the self (Study 2). These results appear to support our hypothesis; even in their daily life-contexts, Kansai people uniquely put a high value on self-denigrating humor for constructing relationships.

42,42,"As the 21st century continues to unfold, two very distinct versions of the father will compete for ascendancy across the worldâs community of cultures. One version is of very recent vintage and casts the role of the social father as supernumerary or optional. Cultures which adopt such a version tend to have high levels of divorce and out-of-wedlock births plus a pervasive cash economy as defining characteristics. The mother-child(ren) dyad tends to become the familial unit of such societies. A second, older, version adheres the father to the mother-child(ren) dyad to form the traditional nuclear family. Without commenting upon desirability, it is argued that, when compared to alternative familial structures, those cultures which both minimize fatherless families and systematically restrict womenâs roles to that of motherhood do and will haveâacross generationsâa demographic advantage. And, in terms of cultural evolution, i.e. across generations, those cultures which emphasize triadic families of father--mother--children are positioned to systematically displace and/or to replace those cultures which emphasize the mother--children dyadic family.

43,43,"Deciding whether to trust another individual is one of the most important decisions a person has to make, especially in social contexts. The ability to make accurate judgements of trustworthiness is predicted to be evolutionarily advantageous. There is evidence for a consistent consensus when rating faces on trustworthiness, and faces rated as both untrustworthy and trustworthy have been shown to activate the amygdala. We investigated the extent to which amygdala activation corresponds to measured trustworthiness associated with facial stimuli. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we scanned 6 participants while they viewed faces of people that varied on The Dark Triad personality characteristics. There was significant activation in the amygdala in response to faces associated with high psychopathy, high Machiavellianism and high trusting behaviour. The findings support recent work demonstrating the relationship between facial morphometric geometry and personality traits. The psychopathy findings in particular supports recent work suggesting threat to be a large component of implicit trustworthiness decisions and also suggests the neural substrates associated with cheater detection are attuned to facial geometry that might represent psychopathy.

In order to maximise their fitness, each party attempts to impose its own preferences to the other exercising thus evolutionary pressure on each otherâs behaviour. This paper examines the effects of this co-evolutionary process over parental and mating behaviour by testing two hypotheses. First, it is hypothesised that parents and offspring have evolved to prefer as in-laws and spouses, respectively, individuals who are overall acceptable by each other. Second, it is hypothesised that women have evolved to be more sensitive than men to their parentsâ approval of their spouses.

45,45,"The current studies tested the prediction that the visceral experience of hunger would lead men and women to show sex-specific preferences for mature partners because of the perceived value of mature characteristics under conditions of resource scarcity. Across two studies, unique samples of college students (N = 328) were asked their preferences about ideal mates before or after eating dinner at a dining hall. Consistent with predictions, hungry males preferred females with more physically mature features, specifically females who were relatively heavier, taller, and older. Female participants who were hungry showed a marginally elevated preference for partners with a more mature personality profile. Hunger salience, manipulated by varying when hunger was assessed, had little effect on the overall pattern of results. Collectively, these studies indicate that visceral states can influence perceptions of environmental security, resulting in a preference shift for partners with characteristics that imply elevated maturity.

It is not surprising, therefore, that both males and females perceive female figures as more attractive as leg length increases, in proportion to torso or stature, and perhaps the opposite should be true for male figures. Both evolutionary and sociocultural factors can play a role in the effect, such as the emphasis on longer legs in images of attractive women. To isolate leg length from other factors we conducted three studies using an extremely simplified type of stimulus: stick figures. Results using three different dependent variables (a forced choice, a rating, and a production task) confirm a role for leg length in attractiveness judgments, modulated also by level of estimated self-attractiveness. We discuss the potential of simplified stimuli, which do not attempt to appear realistic, as a tool in the study of factors affecting attractiveness.

Thirty-nine attributions for poverty questionnaire were completed by a total sample of 460 (male = 285, female = 175). Principal factor analysis revealed that the respondentsâ poverty attributions could be distinguished along three main dimensions: structural, individualistic and fatalistic. The findings of the study showed that youths in Bahir Dar were more inclined to attribute poverty to structural factors. Group breakdowns revealed some important significant differences related to the respondentsâ demographic variables and socioeconomic status of parents. The respondentsâ sex and educational level had statistically significant main effects on fatalistic and individualistic attributions of poverty respectively. Similarly, parentsâ income level showed main significant effects on the structural dimension of poverty. Statistically significant interaction effects were also observed among demographic variables and socioeconomic status of parents on the three possible explanations of poverty. The result suggests that respondents perceived potential causes of poverty to be more structural than individualistic thereby emphasizing more on community based poverty reduction intervention strategies. The results of the study also provided an insight on the way Bahir Dar youthsâ perceive poverty, with recommendations for developing poverty reduction interventions accordingly.

The present experiment tested this hypothesis by asking participants to assess personality characteristics of unknown individuals who either wore a cross pendant, a symbol of Christianity, or a plain chain, using the Evaluation Of Others Questionnaire (EOOQ). The results indicated that participants who scored high on the Doctrinal Orthodoxy subscale of the Religious Orientation Scales gave greater scores to those wearing the cross pendant on the Kindness/Morality subscale of the EOOQ. This result is consistent with others that reported greater cooperation in economic games.

52,52,"Lactation was a critical and defining adaptation for mammals. For most mammals, nursing is a relatively straight-forward process that is largely automatic. Primates however generally require learning to be able to successfully nurse their offspring. Humans are no exception, and in fact, appear to require more learning than most mammals due to the novel sucking technique employed by human infants. Social support is also a crucial factor for breastfeeding success. Breastfeeding was crucial for survival in the evolutionary past, so this leads to an interesting question- why is the absolutely vital skill of breastfeeding so challenging for human mothers to learn? While there, as of yet, no firm answers, I propose three (not necessarily exclusive) possibilities: extremely altriticial infants, challenges due to relatively large breasts, and the (until now) continued presence of learning opportunities in the environment of evolutionary adaptation.

54,54,"This study documents that men and women experience and perform consumer shopping differently, and in ways consistent with adaptations to the sexually dimorphic foraging strategies utilized during recent human evolution. There is an abundant literature on sex differences in spatial abilities and object location that follow from the specific navigational strategies associated with hunting and gathering in the ancestral environment. In addition to sex differences in navigational strategies, the unique features of hunting and gathering may have influenced other aspects of foraging psychology that underlie sex differences in modern male and female shopping experiences and behaviors. Scales were developed to assess several aspects of shopping psychology that may be based on sexually differentiated ancestral adaptations. Results generally confirmed the predicted directions of sex differences. Compared to men, women relied more on object oriented navigation strategies and scored higher on skills and behaviors associated with gathering, the degree to which shopping is seen as recreational, the degree to which shopping is a social activity, and the tendency to see new locations as opportunities for shopping. Men scored higher on skills and behaviors thought to be associated with hunting. Most effect sizes were moderate or strong.

What is interesting is that the field is dominated by studies of issues that represent only small segments of the population (e.g., the behaviour of those who are single or seeking an alternative mate) and often in a specific and unreached stage of a romantic relationship (e.g., mate poaching or dissolution).

61,61,"Males appear to focus more on physical cues in evaluating female attractiveness whereas females consider a wider range of evaluative criterion including possibly other femaleâs opposite-sex interest, with similar proclivities being documented in a range of non-human species. Two experiments were conducted to investigate such âmate-copyingâ tendencies in humans. Male and female undergraduates (Experiment 1) were asked to rate the attractiveness of a photographically presented opposite-sex target model either alone or surrounded by same-sex peers instructed to simulate attraction to the opposite-sex target. Other male and female undergraduates (Experiment 2) rated the attractiveness of the same model presented with either no information relating to previous participantâs attractiveness ratings or artificially enhanced, fictional rating information. Both sexes rated models higher when provided with elevated rating information, however, no sex-differences were evident thus demonstrating equal conformity levels. With visual simulated attraction cues, however, females but not males were influenced by other femalesâ attraction to the model, thus providing evidence for mate copying in human females.

62,62,"Magical thinking has often been viewed as a cognitive mistake rooted in a poor understanding of causality, which can be fixed with education and experience. However, an alternative interpretation is that magical thinking may be highly adaptive in specific situations. This article attempts a theoretical argument that although magical thinking may be illogical, it does provide survival benefits, specifically the modification of anxiety. Based on the previous assumption there would exist an asymmetric survival cost between magical and logical thinking for situations dealing with unmanageable threats. Given that unmanageable threats cause anxiety, and are unlikely to be influenced by human action, and anxiety has a negative influence on an individualâs health, memory, and task performance, we can conclude magical thinking could be viewed as something more than a cognitive mistake. Instead magical thinking should be viewed as an adaptive and functional cognitive tool which is an evolutionary by-product or adaptation.

64,64,"Reviews the book, Hooking Up: Sex, Dating and Relationship by K. Bogle (2008). The author reviews the cultural phenomenon of ""hooking up"". Her primary focus is on the historical and contextual changes that have occurred over the last few decades that lead to these uncommitted sexual encounters replacing the traditional dating script on university and college campuses. This book may be of interest to those determined to better elucidate the behaviors, outcomes, and feelings associated with this recent sexual interaction, as the two-way dialogue between the author and her interviewees offers a depth of questioning not afforded to researchers relying on exclusively on surveys. One central theme that the book addresses is the sex differences noted in the author's interviews. One of the most unsettling aspects of the book was that females were portrayed as desperate to find long term partners in a male dominated sexual ""playground,"" a theme that requires balance. The author suggests that the growing inequality of numbers of women and men on campuses have resulted in men becoming a scarce resource for which women need to compete. Indeed one of its most notable strengths lay in the fact that it is based on one-on-one interviews that allowed for follow-up questions and clarifications of responses, a luxury not granted to the researcher using anonymous surveying techniques. This qualitative approach fills a very obvious void in the growing body of literature on uncommitted sexual experiences.

65,65,"Life history theory is a mid-level evolutionary approach that is increasingly being utilized in psychology to examine ontogenetic development. In life history theory there are two prototypical strategies for facing the challenges of growth and reproduction. Differences in these strategies have primarily been thought to be caused by genetics, early life experiences, or a combination thereof as seen in gene x environment correlations and interactions. Although not exclusive of other views, an alternative view is that life history strategies afford a degree of behavioral flexibility and are adjusted based on situational cues. The cue examined in the current study was life expectancy.

68,68,"To investigate how cultural values are practiced in real-life settings, the present study explored strategic aspects of cultural schema, which function in actual execution of culturally valued behavior. We focused on Self-denigrating Humor Schema (SHS), referring to a knowledge structure, which guides a person to produce laughter and to present the deprecated self, so that the person can construct friendly relationships with others. We believe that people from the Kansai Province (Osaka-area in Japan) have acquired strategic aspects of SHS, a concrete and direct knowledge of how self-denigrating humor should actually be carried-out to develop relationships. Consequently, they would utilize the strategies of producing laughter and presenting the deprecated self, while engaging in blunder-telling behavior; one type of daily self-denigrating humor. To test this expectation, employing a pen-and-paper method, we asked 57 Kansai and 48 Kanto university students (a comparison group) to exaggerate a blunder-story, in open-end format. Overall, the expected results were demonstrated, suggesting that strategic aspects of cultural schema are a key for investigating how people engage differently in culturally valued behavior in different daily contexts.

70,70,"It is now known that in addition to their psychological and behavioural symptoms, chronic depressive illnesses have damaging effects on both the immune and cardiovascular systems. Given that similar patterns are found in other species, there is a need to determine how such seemingly disadvantageous mechanisms could have persisted over evolutionary timescales. This paper offers an answer by applying inclusive fitness theory to the process of mate selection. To mate selectors, the value of direct observation is limited by the phenotype/genotype disparity. Although it does not seem to have been previously suggested, there is evidence that natural selection has partially circumvented this limitation by favouring the use of the stockbreeding technique of obtaining additional genetic information from a candidateâs close kin. One implication of this is that individuals much less well fitted than their kin can have a negative impact upon the reproductive success of their abler relatives. Indeed, the point could be reached at which the aggregate reputational damage they inadvertently cause imposes reproductive penalties across their kin group substantially in excess of their own likely reproductive contribution. Under such circumstances, as a form of damage control, inclusive fitness considerations would favour the emergence of autonomic mechanisms serving rapidly to eliminate the less well fitted individual. Severe depression, given how life-threatening its symptoms would have been in any imaginable Era of Evolutionary Adaption, could have evolved to bring this about. In this paper, literature relating to: mate choice among peacocks, an island population affected by a debilitating genetic disease, the stigmatisation of families of psychiatric patients, the determinants of self-esteem, and the psychological factors underpinning human health and happiness has been reviewed against four hypotheses derived what the author terms ""stigma theory"". Although much remains to be done, the initial findings are strongly supportive.

Furthermore, these studies tend to treat individualism and collectivism simply as grouping variables of traditionally individualist and collectivist cultures. This study was the first to examine individualism and collectivism effects on sociosexuality within a single culture, measuring individualism and collectivism by (1) ethnic group (White or Asian American), (2) measured individualism-collectivism, and (3) individualism/collectivism targeted toward an in-group (i.e., friends, family) and social obligation group (i.e., colleagues, neighbors). Data were collected from 200 White and/or Asian American college students. Sociosexuality was predicted by individualism/collectivism, where higher levels of individualism reflected a more unrestricted sociosexuality. And collectivism targeted toward an in-group solidarity group was associated with a more restricted sociosexuality while collectivism toward a social obligation group resulted in a more unrestricted sociosexuality. Discussion addresses limitations of the current research, highlighting the importance of appropriately measuring individualism and collectivism and its influence on sustaining relationships in a time of diverse cultural values.

73,73,"The nature of choice, whether it is to some extent ""free"" or completely determined, has implications for moral responsibility and mind-body dualism; this issue may also affect how we think of ourselves as members of the human species in comparison to other animal species. In the current study, we explored whether the ""common college student's"" perception of free or determined choice, moral responsibility, and mind-body dualism in humans extended to chimpanzees and rats. Humans were perceived as significantly different from chimpanzees and rats on all three of these dimensions. Moreover, chimpanzees were perceived, primarily by women, as significantly different from rats on the dimensions of free (versus determined) choice and moral responsibility. However, on the issue of mind-body dualism, or having a spirit, a significant difference was not found between chimpanzees and rats. Perhaps possessing a spirit separate from the physical body may be considered a uniquely human attribute. As we become more aware of genetic similarities between our own species and other primate species, our attitudes towards choice, moral responsibility, and mind-body dualism may change.

Although the findings are unequivocal, in general studies haven't applied an evolutionary perspective when discussing the findings. Therefore this study aimed to apply evolutionary principles to friendship, by looking at the relationship between trait Machiavellianism and friendship quality, using the Mach IV (Christie  Geis, 1970) and the Friendship and Relationship Quotient scales (Baron- Cohen  Wheelwright, 2003). Participants (N = 292, 217 females) filled in an on-line survey. Irrespective of age and gender of the participant, Machiavellianism was negatively related to rated self-reported importance of friendship.

77,77,"Reviews the book, The murderer next door: Why the mind is designed to kill by D. M. Buss (2005). This book provides a chilling look at the biological propensity for murder that is part of our genetic heritage, regardless of ethnicity, gender or geography. The bookâs intended audience is the general, educated public, but it is especially relevant for anyone teaching psychology, sociology or anthropology at the community college or university level. We have heard the familiar sociological, economic and physiological theories of murder and violence that were fed to us as students and that we in turn, confidently espouse to our own students. In his book, Buss anticipates much of the criticism directed at an evolutionary theory where violent, murderous impulses are seen as a part of human nature. He also deals with criticism from the feminist perspective that would reject the role of women as cold, calculating creatures seeking mates only to provide resources and security. Buss deserves praise for this provocative book, the Murderer Next Door. While it is often shocking and disturbing, it is likely to lead to important debate about the particular characteristics that compose human nature itself and how we provide evidence for the presence of these traits. We can only advance the social sciences if we have the courage and will to accept the tenets of a theory that may not be popular or positive. This is sometimes difficult during a time when we are expected to be politically correct in the classroom and in the courtroom. In turn, recognizing and accepting the traits that are not so flattering in our nature may lead to changes that ultimately improve society as a whole.

78,78,"Sociosexual norms, as well as marital patterns, vary widely across human history and culture. Yet, humans share an evolved psychobiology of sexual motivation that reliably leads to procreation through incentivizing sexual activity. We predicted that in socially monogamous societies with conservative norms for sexual behavior, the interaction of sexual motivation and strong discouragement of non-marital sex would lead to relatively earlier marriages on average, as young adults seek a socially sanctioned way of expressing their sexuality. We examined this hypothesis with United States Census data from the year 2000. We found that cities in the âBible Belt,â? a region characterized by strong evangelical Christian sentiment, had significantly lower mean and median marital ages for both men and women, supporting our prediction.

79,79,"Menopause has long perplexed evolutionists because it is hard to see how a trait that precludes reproduction for a large portion of a womanâs adult life could have spread evolutionarily. Neither of the two common explanations is scientifically satisfying. The Extended Lifespan Hypothesisâthat menopause is simply a byproduct of the modern expansion of human lifespansâis plagued by its inability to account for gender differences and the fact that many non-human animals also cease reproducing well before the end of life, among other problems. The Grandmother Hypothesis argues that women net more genes in future generations by assisting their descendants than they would by continuing to reproduce directly, but gains large enough to offset a womanâs direct reproductive potential have never been demonstrated. Approaching the phenomenon from the perspective of the gamete rather than the individual suggests a new hypothesis: Female gametes are competing to achieve ovulation, and the high rate of gamete loss that results leads directly to the follicular depletion that triggers menopause. Thus, menopause is a cost imposed upon individuals by gametes that are behaving in their own evolutionary best interest.

In an exploratory analysis of this phenomenon, respondents provided self-reports of various behaviors and traits previously shown to be related to testosterone and finger-length ratios and also indicated whether or not their second toe was the longest of their toes (i.e., extended beyond their other toes). Results yielded a significant association between longer second-toe length and left-handedness for both men and women. For women only, relationships between a longer second toe and a competitiveness orientation, a winning orientation, and physical aggression were found. For men only, a relationship between a longer second toe and exercise frequency was found.

Women have greater incentives for establishing relationship commitment than men because of their greater necessary investment in offspring and the benefits of long-term paternal investment. Thus, sex differences in PCTI experiences may emerge based on sex differences in reproductive strategies. We generated 16 items to assess PCTI experiences and extracted three factors related to: 1) satisfaction and bonding, 2) a desire for more signals of bonding and commitment from oneâs partner, and 3) romantic partners having a greater interest in talking about relationship issues. Consistent with our predictions, womenâs satisfaction with PCTI experiences was inversely related to the extent to which they desired greater bonding and commitment signals from their partner, whereas menâs satisfaction with PCTI experiences was inversely related to the extent to which their partnersâ had greater interests in talking about relationship issues. These dimensions were also related to other indicators of reproductive strategies, including attachment style.

One of the most frequently used strategies is competitor derogation, such that people derogate potential rivals with respect to their appearance and personality. What remains unknown is how those who derogate rivals are perceived by others. Here we examine how female derogators are viewed by men (i.e., potential mates) and women (i.e., potential rivals), and investigate whether the form of derogation matters. We used a pre-post research design to document changes in perceptions of derogators who made negative statements about other womenâs appearance, personality or sexuality. Overall, men significantly decreased their evaluations of the derogatorâs friendliness, kindness, trustworthiness and overall desirability as a mate. Women mirrored these results, but also significantly decreased their views of the derogatorâs fitness as a parent and her physical attractiveness, and in the case of appearance derogations, her promiscuity.

Extended involvement in such interactions can lead to negative psychosocial correlates in future social situations for both aggressors and victims. This study investigated whether self-reported peer aggression and victimization during high school predicted how college students behaved during an experimental economics âgameâ? called the sequential Prisonerâs Dilemma. Results show that both aggressive males and victimized females were significantly less likely to reciprocate when interacting with a cooperator, whereas involvement in past aggressive interactions was unrelated to trusting an unknown partner. Interestingly, decisions to punish non-cooperators did not vary with past peer aggression or victimization.

It was hypothesized that voices are a strong index of reproductive viability and therefore, members of both sexes would be most accurate in assessing age of those around puberty and females approaching menopause. Voice samples were obtained from 101 individuals of both sexes, ranging in age from 2 to 67 years and an additional 97 independent raters of different ages were asked to estimate the exact age of the speakers from voice recordings. Results showed that accuracy of voice assessment tended to decrease as the speakersâ ages increased, with assessments of children and adolescents being the most accurate. Overall, raters tended to underestimate the age of speakers as the speaker age increased regardless of the ratersâ own age. Whereas accuracy in ratings decreased when male speakers reached age 46-55, accuracy remained high for female speakers in their menopausal years, suggesting that both sexes are sensitive to vocal changes during this developmental period.

To complement that study, we now perform an exploratory study in which we compare hero and heroine development, with the goal of understanding what women seek in potential mates, and how they ideally conceptualize men. Heroes are always described in considerable detail (e.g., appearance, resources, and career status), while heroines are rarely described in these terms, or in this depth. These descriptions of men are congruent with the evolutionary psychology literature on womenâs mate preferences. We found that heroes undergo noteworthy changes within the books, such that they often start as âcadsâ who are often rude, independent, and aggressive, but by the end of the book they are loyal, devoted men who are in love with the heroine. In contrast, the heroine undergoes only minimal transformation. This desire for a mate who encompasses both a âcadâ and a âdadâ mating strategy is beneficial to women, evolutionarily speaking, because cads may have high gene quality and dads may provide high paternal investment.

The current study fills an important gap in this emerging literature, and provides additional information in an area currently underrepresented in human evolutionary research in general. Previous research demonstrated how proper and dark male heroes in British Romantic literature represent high paternal investment and high mating effort strategies, respectively. This past work showed that people infer reproductively relevant behaviors from brief character depictions, and report preferring interactions with these characters in ways that would enhance their own reproductive success. We conducted a similar experiment investigating variation in female reproductive strategies depicted by six female characters in novels written by Jane Austen. Three women were described as loyal, quiet, âmotherâ? figures, while three were described as active, boisterous and untamed âloverâ? figures. Results show that men recognize the distinct strategies, expressing a preference to marry the âmotherâ? and realizing that the âloverâ? would be more likely to cheat on them. Women recognize that men would prefer the âloverâ? for sexual relations, and believe that the âmotherâ? would be better with children and a better mother. Once again, people intuitively recognized reproductively relevant behavior from brief character sketches. Austenâs intuitive evolutionary psychology may be one reason why her works remain so popular and well respected nearly 200 years after their publications.

87,87,"Very few studies have used an evolutionary approach to help understand fictional heroes, and none have directly addressed how the sex of the author might influence the characteristics of the hero. If evolved behavioral differences in the sexes have influenced the subconscious tendencies of human males and females, these differences should be reflected in the fictional characters each creates. Based on sexual selection and inclusive fitness theory, I predicted that females will be more likely than males to create heroes who have family members, and that family members will be more important in the plotlines of female-generated stories. Information collected from twenty childrenâs fantasy novels published after 1994 display the predicted trends. In addition, male authors often created parents who were problematic (insane, irresponsible, or evil), something the female authors never did. Further, rebellion, revenge or anger were emotions that commonly initiated the action in male-generated stories, but not female-generated stories. If these trends represent a true difference in how males and females visualize heroes, further study into hero differences based on the sex of the author may provide information of interest to those who study gender issues and evolutionary psychology.

A âslowâ? Life History (LH) strategy emphasizes both kin-selected altruism and reciprocal altruism as means of investing heavily in offspring, blood relatives, and mutualistic social relationships with both kith and kin. We therefore investigated whether a slow LH strategy, as a measurable individual-difference variable favoring in-group altruism (positive ethnocentrism), should predict out-group hostility (negative ethnocentrism), and what the direction of the hypothesized effect would be. We found that a multivariate latent variable representing slow LH strategy served as a protective factor against a latent variable representing Negative Ethnocentrism.

Findings revealed that higher hypermasculinity scores in male observers were correlated with higher attractiveness and trustworthiness ratings of the male faces; conversely, higher hyperfemininity scores in female observers were associated with lower ratings on those traits. Male observers also rated the faces as more aggressive than did female observers. Regarding ratings by face type, masculinized faces were rated more aggressive than feminized faces, and womenâs ratings did not discriminate between altered faces better than menâs ratings.

94,94,"According to Buss and Schmittâs (1993) sexual strategies theory, mating strategies depend upon oneâs sex and whether they desire a short-term or long-term relationship. Men typically expend less reproductive effort than women and need only to ensure that they locate fertile mates, regardless of relationship type. Women tend to expend relatively more effort and seek long-term partners who are willing to provide resources, or they may choose mates with high genetic quality for a short-term relationship. Thus, the traits that men and women exhibit to prospective mates should be sex-specific. Our goal was to determine whether the photographs that accompany online personal advertisements reflect an awareness of sex-specific mating strategies, such that the sexes advertise distinct traits to potential mates. After conducting a pilot study, we collected 300 photographs from the online dating service âLavalifeâ? and examined them with respect to relationship type. We found women consistently advertise their reproductive fitness regardless of sought relationship type, directly supporting sexual strategies theory.

In the following two studies, we investigated the relation between willingness to support evolutionary theory in general and willingness to support key tenets of evolutionary psychology.

This latter support remained strong, though diminished, when the relation between evolutionary theory and evolutionary psychology was made explicit to respondents.

The book provides a popularized account to sexology, enlightening female sexual motivation from a psychological, clinical, physiological, cultural and evolutionary point of view. The book is based on a previous study by the bookâs authors in which people had been asked to list reasons why they, or anyone they knew, had previously engaged in sexual intercourse. The authors identified four main factors why women and men have sex, physical, emotional, goal attainment and insecurity further dividable into subcategories such as love and commitment or social status. The book revolves around these subcategories by dedicating a chapter to each of the identified motivation clusters, which have been slightly rearranged for the book. What makes this book really unique, though, is that (clinical) observations, psychological considerations and scientific hypotheses aiming to explain observable patterns are accompanied by the voices of real women. The book gives a wittily written peek into womenâs minds and bedrooms. It provides a thorough - and at this time also probably the most exhaustive overview of all the aspects that are to female sexual motivation.

98,98,"As the fields of personality and evolutionary psychology merge, new conceptualizations of personality traits will arise. However, individual differences continue to present a recurrent problem for evolutionary psychologists. We contend that the heterogeneity of personality traits provides fitness benefits and fitness costs that relate to fitness outcomes. As these costs and benefits balance one another in the course of individuals' lives, only those traits that create a net positive balance will be correlated with improved fitness outcomes. In this study (N = 155), we showed how extraversion provides positive fitness outcomes to both sexes, suggesting that extraversion creates the best balance of positive and negative characteristics and habits of all of the Big Five. In contrast, other aspects of the Big Five were not related to number of lifetime sex partners, suggesting that the positive and negative aspects of those traits create a near-neutral balance.

The present study investigated to what extent computer-generated similarity or dissimilarity can be discerned as phenotypic resemblance or dissimilarity, respectively, on a conscious level. Furthermore, sex differences assumed from female dispersal theory were examined. Three warps, one of computed similarity and one of computed dissimilarity of varying degree to a reference face among them, were presented to subjects, who were asked to indicate the image that they perceived as the most similar or dissimilar, respectively, to the source face. Higher degrees of (dis-)similarity led to higher recognition rates, which, however, never exceeded 80 percent. Women achieved higher recognition rates than men and (dis-)similarity was recognized more easily in female faces by both male and female subjects. We hypothesize that these sex differences are due to an evolutionary adaptation enabling women to recognize potentially remote relatives when they have left their natal groups and joined others to avoid inbreeding.

Less emphasis, however, has focused on sibling relationships as a function of kinship in humans. Evidence suggests that cuckoldry has been an influential factor in our evolutionary history. This raises the question: Do siblings estimate their likely relatedness to one another, and adjust their behavior accordingly? This study used a web-based questionnaire to estimate participantsâ sibling-directed altruism and sexual aversion. These potential indicators of perceived relatedness were found to correlate negatively with several factors that could be indirectly associated with maternal infidelity.

In a comparison likely to amass the most attention, Kurzban relates the brain to an Apple productâa series of applications which perform different functions, some of which communicate with one another. Kurzban begins his modularity argument with an example familiar to many psychologistsâsplit brain patients. Split brain patients show an extreme version of what Kurzban is arguingâone part of the brain, the part responsible for our feelings of ""self"" can deny the ability to see something, yet perform above chance on a task related to the stimuli they claim not to see. Kurzban's defining point is that, due to the specific functions each module is responsible for, there is no way for each and every single module to communicate with one another. Kurzban's defining point is that, due to the specific functions each module is responsible for, there is no way for each and every single module to communicate with one another. Each chapter of Why Everyone (Else) is a Hypocrite gets the reader one step closer to understanding that the things that ""we"" feel are often not the true ""feelings"" within our brain. Modularity, Kuzban explains, informs how context matters. We have some modules that are associated with the basic living necessities, and are referred to as "" ""the four Fs"": feeding, fleeing, fighting, and having sex"" (pp. 159) which are impatient modules, as well as patient modules. Hypocrisy in Kurzbanâs writing is nothing more than competition among modules.

Pictures of individuals who self-identified their sexual orientation were measured for facial symmetry and certain facial proportions. Independent raters were asked to identify the sexual orientation of those in the pictures on a continuum scale. Self-identified heterosexuals had facial measures that were less asymmetrical than homosexuals. The more likely raters perceived someone to hold a heterosexual orientation, the more symmetrical that personâs facial features were. There were few differences seen for the individual, sexually-dimorphic trait measurements between self-identified heterosexual and homosexual individuals; however, an examination of a composite of traits showed that heterosexual men had greater overall masculine facial features than did gay men. Furthermore, the more masculine a maleâs overall facial features were, the more likely he was perceived as being heterosexual.

110,110,"Women in Western societies have made enormous gains in education and labor force involvement since the middle of the twentieth century. Various gender differences persist, however. For example, young men and women in the United States continue to differ in their plans for work and family, with women more likely than men to choose careers that will âwork aroundâ? their family plans (Bridges, 1989). A social constructionist perspective suggests that such differences are the result of societal influences that reinforce traditional gender roles. An evolutionary perspective explains psychological sex differences in work and family priorities as a natural consequence of greater female investment in children over evolutionary history. In the current paper, we test competing predictions about how exposure to collegeâan environment that encourages gender egalitarianism and individual choiceâmight moderate the magnitude of male-female differences in work-family plans. We surveyed broad samples of freshmen and seniors enrolled in a public liberal arts university. Sex differences apparent in first-year studentsâ educational aspirations were absent among seniors. However, men and women at both points in college differed sharply in their plans for working when they had young children at home.

Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding is, most of all, an attempt to describe and evidence the evolutionary emergence of emotionally modern humans. Hrdy evidences her argument that humans' unique position among the Great Apes is a direct result of ""mothers and others"" by positing a series of logical questions, explaining why these questions are relevant to human evolutionary development, and then providing the best available evidence from historical and contemporary studies in animal behavior, primatology, neuroscience, cognitive psychology, human behavioral ecology, and cross cultural ethnographies. Because of lactation, mammals are uniqueâmammalian mothers had to evolve to be more sensitive to their offspring while their offspring were evolving to communicate their needs more effectively to mothers. Hrdy provides the illustrative example of Andrew Meltzoff's experiments in human facial recognition and mimicryâhuman infants will seek out faces, gaze upon them, and imitate the expressions see. In an experiment that challenged long-standing assumptions, Tetsuro Matsuzawa showed that chimp newborns express the same behavior. Mothers and Others is a well evidenced yet highly accessible read. Hrdy writes almost exclusively as an anthropologist and evolutionist; however, she sparingly includes personal observations that are all wholly appropriate and enrich the material.

The text could be used in an Evolutionary Psychology or introductory biology course. It offers a comprehensive overview of heredity, genetics and natural selection. The author manages to be thorough while still explaining every topic as simply and clearly as possible.

Nettle asserts that detractors misunderstand what Evolutionary Psychology is and is not and what this field of psychology tries to accomplish.

The arguments on both sides largely have been at the philosophical level. However, a careful analysis of the notion of falsification implies the possibility of empirical tests of falsification claims centered on the issue of whether the hypotheses are or are not obvious. We present two empirical tests, each carried out with (presumably) less informed (undergraduate students) or more informed (graduate students) samples. The findings strongly support that at least some evolutionary psychology hypotheses are not obvious, thereby rendering them as potentially destructive tests of evolutionary psychology claims. We also tested undergraduate students on their reactions to highly cited evolutionary hypotheses in Studies 3 and 4. These highly cited hypotheses were neither extremely obvious nor extremely surprising.

115,115,"This study seeks to determine the association between gender role attitudes about childcare, utilization of parental leave policies and parental/infant preferences, on the one hand, and the distribution of childcare in the families of assistant professors with children under two on the other. Both utilization of paid parental leave policies by men and menâs belief in non-traditional gender roles are associated with higher levels of participation in parenting tasks. However, even those male professors who take leave and believe in nontraditional gender roles do much less childcare relative to their spouses than female professors do. This result holds even when the male professorâs wife works full time. Our results suggest that one reason why female professors do more childcare may be that they like it more than men do. The association of enjoyment of childcare with gender role attitudes or leave-taking status is not statistically significant, which suggests that sex differences in the enjoyment of childcare will not be easily changed by changes in policies or gender role ideology. Accordingly, when exploring the stickiness of gender roles with respect to infant and toddler care, it would seem prudent to consider biological and evolutionary explanations as well as those focusing on institutions and gender ideology.

116,116,"This study was motivated by anecdotal observations of preschool children's demonizing some animals while playing with animal figures (e.g., calling them ""bad guys""). Interestingly, there seems to exist a cross-cultural history of representing certain animals as evil. In order to understand the psychological underpinning beneath this sociocultural phenomenon, this exploratory study focuses on perceptual cues associated with moral value attribution to animals. In a two-part study on 6-year-old South Korean children, we first contrasted children's drawings of a ""bad"" animal with that of a ""good"" animal in their appearance features. The significant distinguishing traits could be interpreted as the features of an angry person or a carnivorous animal, which in general convey the emotional property of threat. Next, the effects of threatening appearance features on animal moralization were tested and yielded statistical significance. We propose that the process of negative moralization may depend upon the emotional state of fear evoked by specific visual signals with hazardous ecological contents. The communicative role of threatening signals would have been especially important both in interspecies (i.e., sources of selection by predation) and intra-species conflicts during the course of human evolution. Additional implications for understanding how and why cultural representations of demonized animals are created and shared will also be discussed.

117,117,"Nonindependent mate choice occurs when a female (focal female) is influenced in her mate choice by the choices of other females (model females), though sometimes male choice can be similarly influenced. In humans the study of this phenomenon has been almost exclusively experimental, with the perceived level of attractiveness of opposite-sex faces being influenced by manipulation of the attractiveness of their putative partner. As useful as these experimental studies are, the question of how validly they capture real-life social processes has not been addressed. Here we present the results of a questionnaire study which analyzed responses from 206 male and 175 female participants, both singles and people in a relationship. As predicted, paired men reported more opposite-sex interest than paired women, whereas the opposite was true for single respondents. Furthermore, the amount of opposite-sex interest reported by paired men correlated with the attractiveness of their partner, whereas this correlation between partner attractiveness and opposite-sex interest did not hold for female respondents. We suggest that this contrast is related to sex differences in benefits of nonindependent mate choice arising from sexspecific reproductive constraints. Our results are consistent with the kinds of effects recorded in laboratory studies, and provide evidence that non-independent mate choice plays at least some role in actual relationship dynamics.

In order to bridge such a gap in current literature we present a study which attempts to demystify the notion that members of highly industrialized countries are not at high risk for Adjustment Disorder and that the exacerbation of already existing pathologies may arise in conjunction with the delicate process of adjustment. Through the analysis of the clinical demands and psychopathological pictures we have identified some clinical trends in the population studied which indicate a statistically consistent presence of Adjustment Disorder and high rates of pre- and co-morbid pictures, particularly with Mood Disorders, suggesting that the development of Adjustment Disorder represents a risk factor which triggers or exacerbates pre- and/or co-morbid psychopathological pictures.

120,120,"Motivation is a crucial subject because it is known to influence behavior in every domain, including tourism. In tourism research, there have inter alia been debates on a theoretical level about whether extrinsic or intrinsic motivations exert the strongest impact on peopleâs desire to travel for pleasure. Since there does not exist a single work on tourism motivation that empirically addresses this puzzle, this study, by applying an evolutionary approach, examines whether extrinsic or intrinsic factors have the strongest direct effect on peopleâs interest for holidaying. This study represented the extrinsic motivations with two culturally related variables (vertical and horizontal cultural transmission), and captured the intrinsic motivations with two psychological variables (perceptual and epistemic curiosity). Two competing structural models were then constructed and ran on the basis of data collected from a sample (N=1001) of the Norwegian population in 2010. The results show that the extrinsic model is superior to the intrinsic model, which suggests that sociocultural factors have a stronger direct effect on peopleâs interest for holidaying than do psychological factors. Further, the analysis shows both that the extrinsic and intrinsic motivations together explain a considerable share of the variation in interest for holidaying, and that horizontal cultural transmission has the strongest influence on holidaying interest. This study concludes with a discussion of the main theoretical and practical implications.

Then, we revised the measurement model and demonstrated that, when compared against the coupleâs disassortative mating on LHS, a coupleâs mean LHS was the sole predictor of relationship satisfaction, and also a strong predictor of the coupleâs assortative mating on indicators of LHS.

122,122,"Reviews the book, Death from a Distance and the Birth of a Humane Universe by Paul M. Bingham and Joanne Souza (2009). This is an extensive book based on Paul Bingham and Joanne Souza's brainchild; a new theory on human uniqueness. Their theory, simply put, is that the human speciesâ unique ability to throw objects (and thus kill conspecifics, or members of the same species, at a remote distance) has caused humans to evolve in ways never before seen on the planet Earth. The various chapters introduce the reader to the theory gradually; first introducing them to very basic scientific principles, then holding the readers' hands as they walk them through the tenets of their simple, yet elegant, theory of human uniqueness. Finally, they take the reader on a journey through time to see this theory applied throughout the history of humankind (at times, even pre-dating it). Bingham and Souza are overly prepared for critical feedback, and in fact, they welcome any opponents to challenge the basic premise of their theory. Overall, the book truly does what it promises: takes the reader on an intellectual journey. Bingham and Souza work relentlessly to make this book accessible to readers of any backgroundâwhich is important because the theory applies to all aspects of human nature and everyone should be able to understand the basics of what essentially makes a human, human. As one of the constant themes of the book points out, evolution is everywhere and can contribute to a much broader world perspective. For those who are skeptical of the previous statement, this book will be a particularly interesting read. Bingham and Souza are well aware of, and readily welcome, the skepticism that their new theory will elicit, so they make sure to present ample evidence behind each of their claims to answer any criticism that may be lurking in the reader's mind. While this approach is useful for critics, it can at times be redundant for the evolutionarily minded who do not require this persuasion; luckily, the authors do at times alert the reader when some sections can be skipped which was a useful way to get at the heart of the theory for those with a stronger evolutionary background. The chapters in Death from a Distance read well separately and could definitely be used to supplement courses that wish to add an evolutionary perspective.

123,123,"Reviews the book, The Consuming Instinct: What Juicy Burgers, Ferraris, Pornography, and Gift Giving Reveal About Human Nature by Gad Saad (see record 2011-14420-000). This book is designed to be a practical guide to marketers for using basic findings of evolutionary psychology. As the majority of readers are assumed to be inexpert in the evolutionary psychology model, Saad begins with the very basics and then provides rebuttals against nine anti-evolution claims using the accepted logic of most contemporary evolutionists. Saad provides many examples throughout the book that act as a sort of primer on evolutionary psychology's findings of the past fifteen years or so. On ""Darwinian gastronomy"" Saad reviews the arguments regarding morning sickness as a defense against possible toxins in foods, cultural use of spices in tropical climates to reduce microbial load in meat, and gene-culture interaction as regards lactose tolerance in herding populations. The tone of the book shifts notably in the closing chapters where marketing and advertising take the forefront. In a discussion of ""fossils of the mind"" (i.e., memes) Saad provides long lists of songs and movies that evidence recurring tropes in popular media. This attempt to provide a brief introduction to Darwinian literary analysis is weakened, not strengthened, by the structure of the argument. This book is written for an audience with cursory knowledge of evolutionary theory and, one must assume, no knowledge of evolutionary psychology. As such, it does serve effectively as a quick, accessible, and in places, quite funny, introduction to the many fascinating insights evolutionary psychology provides into human behaviorâ obviously with human consumption being the primary focus.

Many common groups â such as religious and political affiliationsâfacilitate this social lifestyle by advocating trust, reciprocity, and cooperation among group members; however, studies on trust and reciprocity tend to manipulate group identity via assigning participants to arbitrary groups rather than investigating the potential relationship with actual social groups (e.g., religion and politics). Therefore, the present study empirically tested the relationships that may exist between actual group memberships, arbitrary group membership, trust, and reciprocity. Two studies (N = 144 per study) were conducted with a computerized âtrustâ? game to measure trust and reciprocity between people based on political affiliation, religious denomination, and arbitrary identification. Results indicated that people trusted their fellow in-group members more than out-group members, and trusted religious and political in-group members more than arbitrary in-group members.

The current study tests the hypothesis that lower WHRs are reliably associated with women and higher WHRs with men, thus serving as a proximate mechanism by which men find lower WHRs more attractive.

A total of 202 Canadians (102) and Chinese (100, living in China) participated in the study. A set of self-developed questionnaires was used in the survey. The results showed that the trust discrimination tendency (TDT) in the trust circle size and trust circle composition is induced by the nature and levels of the shared personal/social information and culture. Specifically, people tend to trust more others in sharing their positive than in disclosing negative personal/social information. Chinese tend to trust fewer others than Canadians do in sharing/disclosing both negative and positive personal/social information. People are more likely to trust their spouse/partner and blood kin in the positive information-sharing domain; in the negative information-disclosing domain, the trust rank of blood kin decreased the most, and spouse/partner decreased least.

Through a mixture of example and metaphor, the author is able to embody these two patterns fully, imbuing each with something akin to a personality and states explicitly that Systems 1 and 2 are a fiction, a teaching tool meant to appeal to our basic cognitive instincts and occasionally reminds the reader of this, encouraging us to appreciate the fiction for what it is, and warning that we not be lured into thinking that these Systems are separate, corporeal entities.

These efforts have considerably advanced the understanding of human psychology and behavior, yet there remains considerable potential to utilize this understanding beyond basic research. We have created the first special journal issue on practical applications of evolutionary psychology to encourage efforts informing real-world challenges. These articles cover topics spanning psychopathology and mental health, pressing social issues such as teenage pregnancy, community and neighborhood conditions, mass-market media, and public policy. Interventions and public policy should be informed by science; we hope that this initial effort is just the first of many journal issues that highlight how evolutionary theory can bring practical benefits to individuals and their societies.

134,134,"This paper proposes a theory of different types of Conduct Disorder based on individual differences in five sex-differentiated evolved personality systems: The Behavioral Approach System (BAS) underlying sensation seeking and aggressive pursuit of reward and social dominance; the Nurturance/Pair Bonding System, low levels of which are linked to the callous-coldhearted personality trait associated with behavior that victimizes others; the Reactivity/Affect Intensity System underlying individual differences in emotional intensity, most notably, in proneness to anger; the Prefrontal Executive Control underlying the ability to control sub-cortical impulses related to behavioral approach and emotionality; and the Behavioral Inhibition System underlying fear and other reactions to personal threat. The most socially destructive combination of these traits appears in individuals who are callous-coldhearted and high on behavioral approach. When low in prefrontal executive control, such individuals are prone to impulsive, emotionally charged reactive and proactive aggression that victimizes others; when high in prefrontal executive control, such individuals are prone to well-planned, non-impulsive proactive victimization of others. Individuals who are not callous-coldhearted are low to moderate on behavioral approach and emotionality, and are high on prefrontal executive control are the least likely to be diagnosed with Conduct Disorder.

136,136,"Ostracismâbeing excluded and ignoredâis a pervasive phenomenon that occurs in a variety of contexts and cultures throughout the world. Diary studies indicate it occurs on a daily basis. Ostracism is painful and distressing psychologically to the person experiencing it, even when it is innocuous and brief. Researchers argue humans evolved detection systems so that individuals can accurately detect and avoid ostracism. Several forms of evidence needed to support a psychological adaptation, such as cross-cultural, hunter-gather, medical, phylogenetic, and physiological evidence, support this adaptation argument. However, direct experimental evidence that appropriate detecting (and responding to) ostracism promotes natureâs criteria (i.e., solves fitness-relevant problems focused on survival and reproduction) would help bolster the case for an adaptation. We review the extant literature through the framework of natureâs criteria, and then propose that direct experimental tests of ostracism detection using research methods from evolutionary psychology and animal models will both add further support to an adaptation argument, and offer fruitful ways of approaching unanswered questions in this research area.

A model is presented that enumerates the possible steps of a research-policy collaboration: a shared interest; data collection; analysis; translating theory into practice.

In striking contrast, our understanding of the evolution of our uniquely massive scale of social cooperation (kinship-independent; subjectively, the âpublicâ? sphere) has been seriously incomplete. We briefly critique theories of human social evolution to identify specific limitations. We then review and expand a specific theory of the evolution of the uniquely human public domain. This theory is coherent and well-supported empirically. Moreover, this theory has the broad predictive fecundity not displayed by earlier, less complete theories. For example, we can predict/account for both individual human novelties (speech, cognitive virtuosity, etc.) and the salient features of the human historical record through the present. We argue that our discipline can now catalyze the long-sought unification of the social and natural sciences. Further, this new theoretical power allows us to understand and address diverse elements of contemporary human welfare with substantially improved clarity. We argue that evolutionary psychology is now robustly positioned to contribute to formulation of potent local and global public policies that can build and sustain a very substantially improved human future.

140,140,"Absent from many studies about climate-change is the motivational connection to human nature. All but gone from the public and natural sciences discourse is any rationale that the environment is not actually the problem; rather, it is human behavior. The predictable result of focusing conservation and environmental research on effects (e.g., climate-change), is avoidance of their ultimate causes. This article argues that this is a form of mass social-institutional denial. People must consume, but they consume in excess for a variety of social and cultural reasons that are simply an extension of human nature. Technological fixes will do nothing more than postpone âovershoot and collapseâ? by 30-50 years, as recent studies show. Denying the origins and complexity of human motivation to consume, while focusing institutional research and public attention on ecological disturbances that exclude human beings is entirely doomed to failure as the environmental measures of the last 50 years demonstrate. Regrettably, 50 years of research has done little to improve the planet and the long-term security of humanity. Studies suggest that the only approach to developing an environmentally sustainable global society will involve the development of a conservation ethics consistent with our evolutionary motives, which evolutionary psychologists could facilitate.

Despite its popularity, there has been little research into the evolutionary underpinnings of why gossip contains particular topics. Furthermore, no one has provided input to those working in gossip-based media. Therefore, we begin by defining and explaining mass media gossip using an evolutionary, biosocial perspective. To demonstrate that the media workers may benefit from relying on knowledge of evolved human nature in their work, we conducted a study. We examined the content of three successful tabloids, using a list of evolutionary-based topics created a priori. The results indicate that tabloids reflect fitness-relevant topics that were important throughout our evolutionary past. The tabloids equally represent both sexes, and while they mostly concentrate on entertainers and royalty, they do pay some attention to unknown individuals. By correlating who and what is gossiped about, we found celebrities are more often the subjects of stories involving wealth, while unknown individuals are almost always gossiped about within the context of life-threatening events. We use our study to provide guidelines for those working in media, which will hopefully enable their work to obtain maximum audience interest.

Here we focus on Western paintings created between 1700 and 1940. Unlike past researchers who have examined the evolutionary foundations of art, we specifically concentrate on paintings by women in order to explore whether their works reflect issues that are specific to womenâs evolutionary history. Our analysis reveals that women tend to paint portraits of self and others, create work with themes of motherhood and family, and paint still life and landscapes. These themes are consistent with the evolved motivations of women, namely the establishment and maintenance of alliances and family relations using depictions of motherhood, family life, and portraits, or more generally, the display of private over public life through the use of still life more commonly than landscape.

However, it is not known whether the ability to detect female fertility is primarily a function of biological sex, sexual orientation, or a combination of both. Using methodologies from previous T-shirt studies, we asked women not using hormonal contraceptives to wear a T-shirt for three consecutive nights during their follicular (ovulatory) and luteal (non-ovulatory) phases. Male and female participants of differing sexual orientations then rated the T-shirts based on intensity, pleasantness, and sexiness. Heterosexual males were the only group to rate the follicular T-shirts as more pleasant and sexy than the luteal T-shirts. Near-significant trends also indicated that heterosexual men and non-heterosexual women consistently ranked the T-shirts, regardless of menstrual stage, to be more intense, pleasant, and sexy than did non-heterosexual men and heterosexual women.

149,149,"Reviews the book, Why Everyone (Else) Is a Hypocrite: Evolution and the Modular Mind by Robert Kurzban (see record 2010-24046-000). Robert Kurzban provides a detailed account of the evolution of massive modularity in the human mind. Here, modularity refers to an organization of specialized and fragmented functioning units within the brain, which is opposed to the view that the mind is comprised of a general-purpose and largely interacting system, or self. Taking an evolutionary psychological perspective, Kurzban states, ""A module is an information-processing mechanism that is specialized to perform some function"". Kurzban details his position for the evolution of massive modularity early in the book, providing arguments against general-purpose functioning in nature. He notes that not only are general-purpose structures rare, but they are less efficient due to the fact they are not structured to serve a particular goal. Similar to other systems, however, he indicates that there should be inherent trade-offs and advantages to specialization. The key feature to this design, and major theme of the book, is that any module might or might not be connected to another one. Kurzban believes that psychological adaptation is modular at every level, and that we should think of different modular systems being more or less in charge at different times. Drawing from fields such as engineering, economics, and computer science, he argues that in order for information-processing systems (like our mind) to be efficient, they must consist of specialized units, or modules. In summary, I agree with the argument presented by Kurzban in that parts of our cognitive architecture appear to be composed of highly specialized and independent modules. For reasons described above, however, it seems plausible that modularity does not exclude the evolution of general-purpose cognitive structures.

151,151,"Reviews the book, Less Than Human: Why We Demean, Enslave, and Exterminate Others by David Livingstone Smith (2011). Deaner begins by elucidating the book's key points: Humans believe that other humans possess some kind of human-like essence, even in cases where individuals are dramatically disfigured, the human mind can conceive of people as subhuman because of five cognitive capacities, most of which are unique to our species, given these cognitive capacities, we are capable of reflecting about the essence of certain âethnoracesâ? and, under certain conditions, conceiving them as possessing a subhuman essence, overriding inhibitions against committing violence typically causes us great psychic harm, and dehumanization is a widespread and possibly universal human capacity; it is not a recent or particularly Western invention. Smithâs book has many merits. One is that it fills an unoccupied and important niche: it is undoubtedly the most comprehensive attempt to identify the cognitive capacities necessary for dehumanization, and it also provides the most thorough historical review of the phenomenon and the writings about it. A second strength is Smithâs engaging, persuasive, and accessible writing. His arguments are supported with evidence from numerous fields, including history, sociology, anthropology, cognitive psychology, and evolutionary biology. Nevertheless, the book overlooks some key questions. First, how does the final accounting of dehumanization in this book differ from more casual usages of the term in other studies (e.g., Marlantes, 2011; Potts  Hayden, 2008; Pinker, 2011)? Second, are some individuals or groups more prone than others to engage in dehumanization? Third, what can be done about the costs of dehumanization to individuals? Lastly, how do we prevent dehumanization from occurring in the first place? In closing, although Smith has not addressed some questions, this should not detract from his achievement. and the reviewer highly recommend this book.

152,152,"Reviews the book, Less Than Human: Why We Demean, Enslave, and Exterminate Others by David Livingstone Smith (2011). In this book, Livingstone Smith has two goals. First, he seeks to demonstrate the pervasiveness of dehumanization as a way to allow individuals to act in a violent manner towards other populations, and does so by showing its existence across culture and time. Therefore, dehumanization is part of human nature, not an artifact of a particular culture or society. Integrated into this discussion is the concept of a moral hierarchy, in that one places the targeted population below oneâs own group, thus stripping them of their humanity and enabling them to be viewed as sub-human. Second, he proposes a theory of dehumanization by which he shows how human nature allows for dehumanization to occur. The topic of moral hierarchies is part of this goal, but he goes beyond this idea and instead teases apart how someone has an appearance versus an essence. That is, someone may appear to be human, but their essence causes them to be subhuman, and consequently, able to be dehumanized. He provides numerous, convincing lines of evidence to support these claims. The book itself is extremely well organized and carefully written, with support for the arguments presented in an intuitive manner. The reviewer concludes that the book is a very crucial first step to our understanding of the darker side of human nature, and how we must truly comprehend the ways in which our cognitions have been shaped over evolutionary time.

153,153,"Reviews the book, Less Than Human: Why We Demean, Enslave, and Exterminate Others by David Livingstone Smith (2011). This is an important book. In seeking to understand the psychological roots of violence, slavery, and genocide, Less Than Human has lofty ambitions, and makes some headway toward achieving them. Drawing from history, psychology, philosophy, biology, and anthropology, David Livingstone Smith weaves together a powerful argument that dehumanization facilitates our longstanding propensity to harm, enslave, and exterminate fellow humans. However, a lack of philosophical precision, overlooked literature, and a failure to consider an adaptationist perspective prevent Less Than Human from fully illuminating our propensity to treat groups of humans inhumanely. Concerns over philosophical precision, literature coverage, and dehumanization's adaptiveness aside, Less Than Human advances a compelling argument that humans dehumanize to treat humans inhumanely. The book serves as a clarion call for further study of dehumanization and the violence, slavery, and genocide it begets. Future research would do well to explore whether our mirror neuron system is deactivated for a group of people once they have been dehumanized and whether those who exhibit less activity in their mirror systems are more likely to dehumanize others. We concur with Smith that the study of dehumanization needs to be made a top priority, and suggest that reading his important, well-written book should be one as well.

154,154,"Reviews the book, Less Than Human: Why We Demean, Enslave, and Exterminate Others by David Livingstone Smith (2011). In Less than Human, David Livingstone Smith conducts a much-needed investigation of dehumanization, which seems to be the mechanism by which humans are able to drop their inhibitions against doing harm to others and commit unspeakable acts of cruelty and horror. The book is rife with vivid examples of atrocities, which appear to be facilitated by the perpetratorsâ ability to think of the victims as subhuman. Smith is not content merely to describe the phenomena; he traces the history of the concept and puts forward a well-conceived theory behind dehumanization based on scientific evidence. Although the book is decidedly philosophical, it should have strong appeal to psychologists with a background in social or evolutionary psychology, as much of the scientific evidence is rooted in these fields. Before covering the content, it should be noted that the quality of the writing and the style of the book make it eminently readable. Smith incorporates many vivid examples and stories that capture the reader and are sure to evoke a visceral response; and yet there is a strong commitment to explaining underlying processes and theories. Readers from a variety of backgrounds will find the book both informative and engaging. The book opens with a series of examples of dehumanization from the Second World War. From Nazi doctors performing lethal and torturous medical experiments on prisoners to the atrocities committed by all sides in the war, we see how soldiers and even doctors were persuaded to think of different ethnicities as subhuman. Smith recounts horrific stories of abuses by all sides, aided by official portrayals of the enemy as animals. An underlying theme here is that the atrocities in the war were not committed by monsters or psychopaths who bear little resemblance to us; they were committed by regular people who would otherwise not be able to bring themselves to perform such acts in civilized society. What is it that enabled them to do so in the context of war? Smith argues that it was their ability to think of their victims as subhuman and therefore not deserving the basic consideration that would ordinarily be afforded a fellow human being. In conclusion, the reviewer states that Smith has written a compelling and thoughtful account of dehumanization that is highly recommended for lay people and professionals alike. We can hope that by having a better handle on some of the factors involved in dehumanization, we may one day be able to diminish its destructive effects. In the final chapter, Smith calls for a scientific approach to dehumanization and empirical study of the subject. The reviewer suggests that two areas of study that might bear fruit are the underlying motivations behind dehumanization and the role of cognitive dissonance, which may be a key mechanism in the dehumanization process.

155,155,"Reply by the current author to the book reviews made by Robert O. Deaner (see record 2013-05136-010), Maryanne L. Fisher (see record 2013-05136-011), Barry X. Kuhle  Matthew Meyer (see record 2013-05136-012) and Edward D. Sturman (see record 2013-05136-013) on the original review, Less Than Human: Why We Demean, Enslave, and Exterminate Others by David Livingstone Smith (2011). Deaner is unhappy that I have not provided a comparative semantic analysis of the various uses of ""dehumanization"" in the literature, and takes this to be equivalent to my not discussing the theoretical advantages of my approach as compared to other explanations of dehumanization. These two claims are logically distinct. The first is a matter of semantics, and the second is a matter of explanatory substance. With regard to the first, early on in the book I briefly discuss the range of uses to which the severely overtaxed term ""dehumanization"" has been put, and I did not (and do not) see anything to be gained from a more elaborate discussion along these lines. With regard to the second point, theoretically sophisticated discussions of dehumanization are exceedingly thin on the ground. Consequently, there's not much in the literature to address. Fisher raises several pointsâall of them well-takenâabout how my account of dehumanization might inspire further empirical research. There is just one point in her review that I would like to address. Fisher is curious about how our propensity to change our views about othersâto see them as subhuman at one point in time and then human at anotherâcan be reconciled with my claim that we tend to regard essences as immutable. The appearance of conflict is based on a conceptual confusion. Kuhle and Meyer offer three criticisms. The first concerns what they take to be my philosophical imprecision. They claim that I do not justify why I included certain authors, but not others, in the chapter on the history of the concept of dehumanization. The history of dehumanization has never previously been written, and I make no pretention of having provided a comprehensive account of it. Hopefully, others will contribute to the narrative that I sketched. Readers of Sturman's review might come away with the impression that I endorse the massive modularity hypothesis, and that my argument somehow depends upon it. But I don't and it doesn't. Much of his review is taken up with a discussion of cognitive dissonance (also mentioned by Kuhle and Meyer). Sturman is correct to say that the notion of cognitive dissonance has some relevance to my thesis, but I am uncertain whether it adds anything of substance to it. Dehumanization is not just a mechanism for resolving psychological tension, as the theory of cognitive dissonance would suggest. If I am right, it has the function of undermining inhibitions against violence. It's true that people sometimes characterize others as less than human as a post hoc justification for bad behavior, but dehumanization appears to be more than mere rationalization. It is facilitative rather than justificatory: when we dehumanize others we really believe that they are creatures of an inferior kind, and this releases our propensity for violence rather than simply legitimizing it.

158,158,"Punishment is crucial to the maintenance of cooperative systems, but it requires investment on the part of individuals. Some evolutionary theorists argue that it is in the best interests of cooperators to punish norm violations, while others argue that more selfish individuals are better equipped to absorb the costs. We argue more generally that those who derive the greatest benefit from group living will have both the resources and incentive to engage in costly punishment, independent of their inclination towards cooperation. To test this hypothesis, we administered an experimental economics âgameâ? that included measures of cooperation and costly punishment, and a survey assessing individual access to social and financial resources. Our hypothesis was validated by three main findings: cooperators and defectors punished with equal frequency and intensity; individuals with greater access to social resources were more likely to punish non-cooperators; and punishers with greater access to financial resources were more likely to invest the maximum amount in punishment.

Findings from a number of studies suggest that among these shifts is a willingness to engage in criminal behaviors. Using the framework of the general theory of crime, this possibility was explored more directly by examining differences in self-control and criminal intent under three different life expectancies (5 months, 5 years, and 50 years). The results revealed that under conditions of short life expectancy, self-control decreased and criminal intent increased, but that this effect was moderated by individual differences in life history strategy.

160,160,"There is strong evidence for social evolutionary motivations for helping (e.g., reciprocal altruism) and also growing support for the influence of the social cognitive theory of moral cleansing on prosociality. Where the former motivation is interpersonal, the latter is intrapersonal. This experimental study hypothesized that, in addition to main effects of evolutionary altruism and moral cleansing on helping intention, an interaction would occur between these theoretical motivations. Using three situational helping scenarios as dependent measures, the effect of participantsâ morally-valenced recalled behavior (moral/immoral/achievement/failure) and the effect of their social proximity to a helping target (cousin/colleague/stranger) on helping intention was determined. Overall, 616 Australian participants (90.1% female) completed the online experiment. Two-way ANOVA demonstrated a consistent main effect of social proximity on helping intention across all three helping scenarios, supporting evolutionary social psychological explanations for helping. However, instead of moral self-regulation effects, moral identity consistency effects were induced by the moral behavior recall manipulation. A main effect of behaviour recall on helping intention occurred, with moral recall increasing helping intention. The problem of theoretical ambiguity regarding moral identity consistency and moral self-regulation is discussed, as is the useful role of null result publications in informing effective experimental design.

Therefore, sex-typical body shape should be linked to other known physical attributes related to reproductive success. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between sex-typical body shape and morphological traits that signal quality [fluctuating asymmetry (FA), hand grip strength (HGS), digit ratios (2D:4D) and leg-to-torso ratio (LTR)] and their role in reproductive fitness. The relationships among quality indicators were also examined. The results revealed that low FA, high HGS, high LTR, and interaction of FA with right 2D:4D predicted menâs masculine body shape. Females with a more feminine body shape had low HGS, high right 2D:4D, and low LTR compared to those with more masculine body shape. Among quality indicators, no significant relationships were found in both males and females. Moreover, men with more wedge-shaped bodies showed earlier sexual maturation and had more sexual opportunities, whereas such effects were not observed in women. These findings support the evolutionary hypothesis that sex-typical body shape is a reliable signal of health and fertility and a consequence of sexual selection based on genetic and phenotypic quality.

Historical records from several European nations show a rapid increase in average population heights during the 19th century. Improvements in nutrition and public health are known contributors to this increase, but, theoretically, evolutionary selection may have also played a role. Women prefer taller mates, and sexual selection for height has likely contributed to evolutionary changes in human height. However, cultural restrictions on mate selection freedom prior to the 19th century may have blunted the effects of this mate preference. We hypothesized that a shift toward gender equality in 19th century Sweden increased mate selection freedom for women and amplified sexual selection for height. A mathematical model supported environmental factors as the main force driving population height change, and suggested a limited role for sexual selection.

In modern times, mating success must be used as a proxy for RS; however, current measures do not account for relationship quality, which is theorized to have increased RS. A mating success scale (MSS) was created for this study, which measures the quality of participants â most recent short- and long-term sexual relationship. Fifty-one men and 202 women participated. Hypothesized mental fitness indicators (e.g., general intelligence, sense of humor) and other traits (e.g., extraversion) were measured. Results generally did not show support for positive manifold theory.

169,169,"Self-referencing, or the assessment of oneâs own attributes, may play a critical role in human mate choice if an individualâs perceived self-worth for a given personal attribute influences her or his preference for that same attribute in potential mates. We studied the potential role of self-perception in human mate choice in New Zealand college students, using survey-based responses to contrast predictions of the potentials attract versus the likes attract hypotheses. The survey was designed to include a test for a possible source of confounding error, common to survey-based studies: the uniform response bias (URB). Specifically, we included a third section of questions, where participants rated their preference for neutral objects unrelated to mate choice. Our analyses used polynomial regression techniques and corrected for multiple statistical tests. The data revealed a strong positive correlation between perceived self-worth in a particular trait and a declared preference for that same trait in potential mates in both sexes. Critically, we found no correlation between preference for neutral objects and the extent of either self-perception or mate preference, indicating that our results were not the bi-product of URB. These findings provide independent confirmation of previous conclusions that self-perception is likely to play an important role in mate selection by humans and other animals.

170,170,"The article is the result of global and interactive research to test the level of folk psychology and folk physics in a sample of people with autism and a control group without disabilities. Autism is an emblematic disorder to study the modularity of the mind, because it presents a peculiar deficit at the level of folk psychology. The research was conducted globally and completely on-line and consisted of two different tests: âfolk psychology gameâ? and âfolk physics game.â? The results confirmed the strong deficit that autistic people display in the first module and the profound difficulties in understanding other people's intentions and behaviors, but, even considering this, certain aspects of this syndrome are more functional than expected. The lower capacity of inference seems to allow a better perception of the environment and its physical laws. This leads autistic people to avoid common mistakes that normal people make when trying to predict the behavior of objects, especially when they are in motion. The innate ability of typically developing people to make inferences leads them to perceive reality in a too complicated way, which translates into errors of perception. For this reason, autism may have been a functional trait in the past, when the need to understand the physical reality to explore the world was more important than social skills.

172,172,"We hypothesize that distinct mating strategies are identifiable in the female characters created by popular British author Jane Austen. Although Austen wrote her novels in the early 19th Century, and consequently the novels reflect social constraints not applicable to similarly aged women in modern Western societies, we contend that research participants can accurately identify the mating strategies of characters and express relationship preferences consistent with their own fitness interests. Austen's characterizations of women's mating strategies are remarkably similar to depictions in the modern literature of evolutionary psychology. We use personality descriptions of four primary characters assembled from passages in Austenâs novels, Pride and Prejudice and Mansfield Park. When selecting characters with whom to form a hypothetical long-term romantic relationship, participants preferentially chose those who successfully established long-term relationships in the novels. Participants generally favored characters who exemplified short-term mating strategies, such as those who generally valued partners more so for the direct benefits they provided rather than emotional connection, for noncommitted sexual relationships. These results provide stronger empirical support of our hypotheses than earlier efforts.

Since the diffusion of monogamy though conquest and population migration is well documented, we employ network autocorrelation regression models that include the cultural transmission of monogamy as an endogenous predictor variable. Linguistic and spatial transmission processes are found to be significant factors that jointly affect the world-wide variance of monogamy, while religious transmission processes are not significant, suggesting genomic variation may play a role in shaping the incidence of monogamy. Other significant factors are reduction of extrinsic risks due to pathogen stress and endemic violence, a highly articulated extra-household division of labor, and a beneficent environment, results which are consistent with female choice as a binding constraint in marriage decisions.

Sex differences in age preferences have been shown to be quite consistent across a variety of cultures, but the explanations for these findings have varied. From an evolutionary psychology point of view, we predicted that sex differences would be present, even in a sample of Norwegian students. If the findings were based on biosocial theory we should see a significant decrease in sex differences in mate choice (as in actual relationships) and in preferences for age compared to other cross-cultural samples. The predictions derived from evolutionary theory were supported: men wanted younger partners than women, and the preference for younger women increased with the manâs age. Women showed a more stable preference for slightly older men. The actual partner choice, as reflected in current relationships, also supported the prediction: men choose younger partners than themselves, and women choose older partners. These findings support the hypothesis that men have an evolved tendency to be attracted to women who display cues of high reproductive value and women have an evolved tendency to be attracted to men who display cues of status and resources, even in a culture that is internationally renowned for its egalitarianism.

This study examined the ability to make age estimates based upon hearing voice samples of speakers whose ages vary across the lifespan while considering the ratersâ own age and sex. It was hypothesized that voices are a strong index of reproductive viability and therefore, members of both sexes would be most accurate in assessing age of those around puberty and females approaching menopause. Voice samples were obtained from 101 individuals of both sexes, ranging in age from 2 to 67 years and an additional 97 independent raters of different ages were asked to estimate the exact age of the speakers from voice recordings. Results showed that accuracy of voice assessment tended to decrease as the speakersâ ages increased, with assessments of children and adolescents being the most accurate. Overall, raters tended to underestimate the age of speakers as the speaker age increased regardless of the ratersâ own age. Whereas accuracy in ratings decreased when male speakers reached age 46-55, accuracy remained high for female speakers in their menopausal years, suggesting that both sexes are sensitive to vocal changes during this developmental period. These findings illustrate that the human voice may be used as a salient cue for assessing reproductive viability.

The Post-Coital Time Interval (PCTI) may be particularly important for pair-bonding and establishing relationship commitment. Women have greater incentives for establishing relationship commitment than men because of their greater necessary investment in offspring and the benefits of long-term paternal investment. Thus, sex differences in PCTI experiences may emerge based on sex differences in reproductive strategies. We generated 16 items to assess PCTI experiences and extracted three factors related to: 1) satisfaction and bonding, 2) a desire for more signals of bonding and commitment from oneâs partner, and 3) romantic partners having a greater interest in talking about relationship issues. Consistent with our predictions, womenâs satisfaction with PCTI experiences was inversely related to the extent to which they desired greater bonding and commitment signals from their partner, whereas menâs satisfaction with PCTI experiences was inversely related to the extent to which their partnersâ had greater interests in talking about relationship issues. These dimensions were also related to other indicators of reproductive strategies, including attachment style.

In this article, the author reveals how she sees the future of the Feminist Evolutionary Psychology Society as profitably reflecting, accelerating, and analyzing the transformation away from patriarchal modes of representation to more feminist, or call it bi-focal, ones. She discusses the forward thinking of Jane Austen who now graces the UKâs 10 pound note, having replaced Darwin himself. Austen is an icon on multiple levelsâand on one of those levels she is recognized as an avant-garde naturalist who brilliantly, sometimes satirically, described the covert play of (female) cues or âplaysâ? that drove martial outcomesâwhen women were harnessed by corsets and trained to marry on a tight deadline. It is perhaps no accident that Darwin himself avidly read Austen. As Sokol-Chang, Fisher, and their colleagues point out: the underbelly of intra-sexual female competition is an extraordinarily rich and still understudied research lodeâwhether it takes place in a Jane Austen novel, in 21st century girl drama, among the indigenous Tsimane of Bolivia, or indeed among midlife professionals. How our evolutionary back story informs the subtleties of this competition clearly has a lot to tell us about the interplay of gender, emotion, bargaining power, and ambition in todayâs world.

187,187,"While it is accepted within evolutionary studies that social support and social technique-learning are uniquely essential to breastfeeding in humans, public health campaigns continue to draw on medical research to develop agendas that focus on individual responsibility. The messages and actions of these agendas simultaneously medicalize breastfeeding while enacting a nature/culture dichotomy. This paper utilizes historical accounts, evolutionary evidence, and feminist critiques of breastfeeding advocacy approaches to expose the ideologies behind these agendas. It will also address how an evolutionary context provides support for a feminist approach to breastfeeding advocacy and how feminism can, in turn, equip researchers with the tools to examine the evolutionary basis for human behavior within contemporary social constraints. When analyzed, evolution and feminism emerge as complementary components to a more holistic view of maternal breastfeeding behavior and social support.

188,188,"Feminism has contributed to the field of evolutionary psychology by encouraging a female-based perspective. Three topics are explored in this article: research methods, primate studies, and same-sex behavior. The influence of feminism and evolutionary theory on female sexual fluidity will also be discussed. First, feminism has challenged traditional research techniques used by males and advocated a female approach. Doing so has produced innovative findings. Second, evolutionary psychology uses the chimpanzee (a male-dominated species) as a comparative model for humans, while bonobos (a female-dominated species), who are more closely related to humans in many ways, are often overlooked. By studying female primates along with male primates, a better understanding of human behavior can be reached. Third, female same-sex behavior is examined from an evolutionary perspective, whereas it has traditionally been attributed to environmental factors or in direct comparison to male same-sex behavior. Incorporating the feminist and evolutionary approaches, I consider female same-sex behavior, which can be considered sexual fluidity, as potentially adaptive for human females as a result of allomothering.

189,189,"This letter argues for an understanding of Darwinian feminism that is rooted in the contemporary intersectional feminist theorizing that seeks to represent historically marginalized groups in an inclusive, non-marginalized manner. To this end, a feminist approach to sexual orientation is presented and detailed, with a historical example of such an approach that already existed within behavioral science but that has been lost over time. The feminist approach presented is inclusive of homosexual, bisexual, and other minority sexual orientations alongside heterosexual orientation in a manner that does not posit paradoxes or otherwise marginalizing conceptions. Finally, the importance of such feminist theorizing as a part of the future of evolutionary psychology is discussed.

190,190,"This letter explores womenâs representation within evolutionary-focused academic publications to support the need for such âradicalâ? approaches as feminist evolutionary psychology. Data regarding authorship of journal and conference papers within evolutionary psychology show evidence of a strong male bias in the number of male authors and an even stronger bias with respect to the number of first authors. This bias hinders womenâs attainment of recognition as distinguished and influential scholars, and thus, it is suggested that feminist approaches are critically needed to ensure that womenâs ideas, views, and interpretations are adequately heard.

191,191,"The Strategic Differentiation-Integration Effort (SD-IE) hypothesis predicts regulation by life history speed (K) of the magnitudes of the correlations among its components, such that individuals with slower life history strategies exhibit life history traits that are less correlated with each other than individuals with faster life history strategies. This conative differentiation among high-K individuals is proposed to arise due to the elevated social competition in stable, predictable environments faced by these individuals and to facilitate mutualistic rather than antagonistic social interaction strategies via social-ecological nichesplitting and domain-specific resource allocation. We tested the predictions of SD-IE regarding relations among life history traits using the Continuous Parameter Estimation Method on data from two college student convenience samples, one all-female sample (N=382) and one mixed-sex sample (N=205), as well as two nationally-representative samples of the US population, the MIDUS (National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States, N=2080) and the NLSY (National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, N=5082). The predicted SD-IE effects were statistically significant and in the expected negative direction among most indicators of the lower-order slow life history factors and among all indicators of the single higher-order slow life history Super-K factor.

192,192,"Unlike many social psychological theories that are limited by the Western cultural context in which they were developed, attachment theory is an exception in that it has been examined across cultures. However, existing cross-cultural research on attachment is limited in scope: there is little to no research on how attachment distributions vary based on ethnicity and religion, and it remains unclear which aspects of culture influence attachment outcomes. The current study expands the body of research on attachment theory by examining attachment as a function of country of origin, ethnicity, religious denomination, individualism/collectivism, and acculturation. We assessed attachment in an ethnically and religiously diverse sample that encompassed over fifty countries of origin, and found that attachment patterns varied based on region of origin, collectivism, acculturation, and ethnicity. These findings have broad implications, both for clinical usage and for empirical cross-cultural understanding.
